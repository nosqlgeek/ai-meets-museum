| 1     | Image based                                          | It should be possible to take photos of artifacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1.1   | Take a photo                                         | As a Museum Scientist, I want to be able to take a photo of a new artifact in order to get this artifact added to my collection. The device with which I take the photo can be a mobile phone. Alternatively, it would also be possible to upload a photo that was taken with a camera via a desktop/web application.                                                                                                                                                          |
| 1.2   | Basic artifact details                               | The artifact record should be created with an initial entry number assigned. It should be possible to change the proposed entry number at a later point in time. The entry number needs to be unique. We should also note the date/time of the photo. Such an entry should also have a short description and information about who added it. In addition, we should be able to distinguish between newly added and already entered artifacts within the 'museum entry book'. |
| 1.3   | Synchronization with the inventory of the collection | As a Museum Scientist, I want to continue working on the artifact details via a (desktop/web) inventory application. Data should be shortly available in this app after I took the photo of the artifact. At this point, an inventory number gets assigned to an artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                                                                                                                                                 
| 2     | Similarities and recommendations | We want to find similar artifacts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 2.1   | Most similar artifacts of the collection             | Based on the photo that I just took, I as a Museum Scientist, want to see the properties (and the photo) of the top 10 most similar artifacts within my collection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2.2   | Recommended properties                               | As a Museum Scientist, I don't want to fill every detail in manually. Instead, the application should propose/recommend me properties based on similar artifacts within my collection. It needs to be possible to override these recommendations. It would be good if the app proposes good alternative values.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 2.2.1 | Relevant properties                                  | The following properties are relevant: The type of the artifact based on the Thesaurus of the museum, the color of the artifact, the estimated size of the artifact, and the material of the artifact.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3     | Artifact search and details                          | As a Museum Scientist, I want to be able to find artifacts that were added to the collection. I want to be able to see and modify artifact properties.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 3.1   | Artifact search                                      | It should be possible to perform a direct search for artifact properties and a full-text search on artifact descriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3.2   | Update, read, remove                                 | It should be possible show and update artifact details. In addition, we would like to mark artifacts as 'removed from the collection'. The museum entry book is immutable, but objects can be marked as being 'removed from the collection', which is not the same as being 'deleted'.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

## Implementation idea

A museum usually has already existing objects that are not yet in the inventory. Those objects already entered the museum ages ago, and they would typically not be gathered via the museum's entry book. Instead, the object is added directly to the inventory of the collection. Because the integration with the existing inventory software of the museum is out of the scope of this project, I would propose that we do the following:

1. Develop one web app with three masks: Entry book, inventory artifact details, and inventory search.
2. The museum entry book mask does the first basic information gathering and photo upload. We could replace this part easily with a mobile application, too.
3. We can then take a new entry over into the inventory by assigning an inventory id. When the artifact is saved with an inventory number, we mark it as 'entered' in the entry book.
4. The artifact record within the inventory will then show similar objects and recommend the properties. 
5. Furthermore, the inventory page (artifact details page) will allow us to override any recommendations. As soon as we save the artifact record, we mark it as 'curated' within the inventory.
6. We will also implement a search mask to find artifacts based on full-text search and other properties (e.g., the inventory id). As soon as you click on an artifact in the search result, you get back into the artifact details mask that shows similar artifacts within the database again. It also allows you to modify properties.

> Note: An actual museum inventory software is much more complex by usually having additional modules (like, for instance: lending management, location management, and provenance). We will focus on the properties of the artifact only.
